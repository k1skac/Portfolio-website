Hello, my name is Bal√°zs Kaczor and this would be my introduction or portfolio website. Although I graduated as a backend developer, I am also interested in web development, so I thought I would combine the two and create this site. 

On the frontend side, the tools I used are Javascript, HTML, pure css (I would like to develop this into tailwind or bootstrap later), and React and its associated Swiper. Also Google Fonts and BoxIcons were used to help me.

However, as I wanted to practice and improve my Java skills at the same time, I decided to take the hard way instead of the easy way, so I also built a Java project for the Contact form with CorsConfiguration, Spring Security, Java Mailsender and the associated dependencies. So it can actually send the completed form as an email to me. The backend runs using Maven, and after startup it runs on port 8080. I hope you like my finished work. 

Of course more modifications are still to come! Have a nice day!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
