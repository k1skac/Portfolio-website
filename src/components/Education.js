                            <p>After feeling that teaching was no longer enough for me, I was a bit burnt out and wanted something completely new.
                                 I had been interested in programming for a long time, but I was always afraid to take the plunge. 
                                 I finally plucked up the courage to apply to GFA as a backend developer. 
                                 I passed all my exams on the first attempt and fell more and more in love with programming. Now I want to use and expand the knowledge I have gained here.

                                <h3>Master Degree -University of Pécs</h3>
                                <p>In 2002 I was admitted to the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Pécs. 
                                    Here I started my studies to become a teacher of Hungarian language and literature and history.
                                     I wanted to work with children, to shape them, to educate them and to pass on my knowledge.
                                      It is a great thing to shape the future generation!</p>

                                <p>During this time, I gained a double degree, becoming a teacher of Hungarian language and literature and a history teacher at the same time. At that time,
                                     I thought that educating the future generation would be my path.</p>

                            <p>Now that I have completed the course, I would like to finally enter the job market as an aspiring backend developer or a beginner fullstack developer.
                                 I want to start as a member of a good community, I hope you can help me.  </p>

                                <p>After that I wanted a bigger challenge, so I joined the local Perczel Mór High School, also as a secondary school teacher and class teacher. Here I could expect more professionalism, more responsibility and more work. 
                                    Every year I improved the Hungarian entrance exams of the students in the district and every year (often several times, in several classes)
                                     I gave the students their school-leaving exams. I look back on these five years with fond memories. </p>

                                <p>My first job was at the Gyula Krúdy Vocational School in Siofok, where I worked as a secondary school teacher and class teacher for 10 years. 
                                    Here I learned the basics of teaching, the most important elements of my profession, and I spent these 10 years working hard and in a good atmosphere.</p>
